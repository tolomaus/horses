Client side (Javascript - Canvas):
I) Either by navigating to apps.facebook.com/whitehorsefarm or by clicking on the app within Facebook
  1) not logged on - not connected
    FB does a POST to "/" with an invalid signed_request
    WHF shows the index page telling that the user must first log in from the top frame
    After the user has logged in, FB will immediately ask the user to authorize the app
    After the user has approved, FB will do another POST to "/" but now with a valid signed_request
    Pages#index will redirect to horses
  2) not logged on - connected

  4) logged on - connected
  5) invalid access token (log off - log in)
    a) When navigating to WHF from the APPS link, FB will send a valid signed_request which WHF will use to replace the old one
    b) When the FB js SDK is loaded on the current page and when logging of - on from another page, FB will automatically notify the user on the WHF tab that he must sign back in. Once the user has signed back in , FB will (probably) do a POST to "/"
    c) When the FB js SDK is not loaded on the current page and when logging of - on from another page, when clicking a link on the current page, the user doesn't notice anything (to be further investigated what actually happens here)
    d) When navigating to a non-root url from a new tab WHF will throw an error saying that the access token is not valid anymore. (Navigating to "/" should solve the problem.)
    2012/01/01: d) seems to work fine without the user noticing anything ...
II) By navigating to whitehorsefarm.herokuapp.com
  The page that is loaded will automatically redirect through js to apps.facebook.com/whitehorsefarm/<path>

TODO (but not necessary at the moment):

  3) logged on - not connected
  4) logged on - connected
