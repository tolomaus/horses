https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug
Then supply the url of your object (e.g.: http://horses.herokuapp.com/horses/8)

Open Graph API Explorer:
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer
Then supply an object id: https://graph.facebook.com/OBJECT_ID
Or an object url: https://graph.facebook.com/OBJECT_URL
Or an FQL query: https://graph.facebook.com/fql?q=SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1=me()
It will show the properties of the object in json format

Sample PHP app using the Open Graph:
https://github.com/facebook/Social-Cafe-Sample

Show more info on an object id:
https://www.facebook.com/me/activity/OBJECT_ID

Post an action on an object:
https://graph.facebook.com/me/spookje:<action>?horse=<OBJECT_URL>&access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN> (HTTP POST)

Update an object:
https://graph.facebook.com?id=<OBJECT_ID or OBJECT_URL>&scrape=true

FQL:
SELECT url, id, type, site FROM object_url WHERE url = OBJECT_URL
SELECT url, id, type, site FROM object_url WHERE id = OBJECT_ID

Use the Open Graph API Explorer to run an FQL query: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer
