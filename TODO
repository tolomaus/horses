Release 1:
- Use FQL to retrieve the id of a new horse instead of sending an update request
- Add action buttons on the index page (Ajax)
- Use the facebook look and feel
- Add "friends who are using this app", also show their horses
- Add "Others who are using this app", also show their horses
- Add / remove some fields: date of birth, ridden since, "special properties"
- Use a FB dialog to select or upload a picture of the horse
- Add a link to a photo album & video album
- Translate the app in Dutch & French
- Get the flash message shown wherever necessary
- Create a logon screen showing the user's friends that also use the app (to be finished up)
- Cache the channel file: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/
- Re-add returning_user cookie to avoid the redirect index->horses delay for returning users

- Investigate why the app is not shown inside the facebook container after authenticating for first time usage

- Register a permanent domain name (e.g. whitehorsefarm.org) before going live because the url is used as the identifier of a horse

Release 2+:
- possibility for the user to send messages to the users that have liked his horse:
curl -F 'access_token=...' \
 -F 'message=Hello Likers' \
 -F 'id=http://www.myopengraphpage.com/page1.html' \
 https://graph.facebook.com/feed


DONE:
- Logging in: check if the access_token is still valid (now this is done by finding "zuck" but there should be a more reliable way)
